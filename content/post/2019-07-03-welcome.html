<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>Welcome to R Fridays! The goal of R Fridays is to provide a group environment for solving problems in biology/biochemistry data analysis (best practices for statistics, visualization, etc.). Bring your own data and questions, or just come to learn from problems that others are working on.</p>
<p>R fridays are held every Friday from 3pm-4pm in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TDA4sbdg1obfX1Ft7">Light Hall 618</a> (Vanderbilt University). We will strive to provide snacks.</p>
<p>Before your first R Friday, make sure that you have R and RStudio installed on your machine.</p>
<div id="r" class="section level2">
<h2>R:</h2>
<p>To check if R is installed on your machine, open up a command line (terminal) window and type</p>
<pre><code>R --version</code></pre>
<p>The above should produce the following:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>R --version</code></pre>
<pre><code>## R version 3.5.3 (2019-03-11) -- &quot;Great Truth&quot;

<p>If this doesn’t work, you can download R <a href="http://www.r-project.org">here</a>.</p>

<div id="rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>RStudio:</h2>
<p>RStudio is an integrate development environment (IDE) that simplifies writing and running R code. You can download RStudio Desktop <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">here</a>.</p>

<div id="key-resources" class="section level2">
<h2>Key Resources</h2>
<p>These two online textbooks are fantastic resources for learning best practices in statistics and R programming.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/">Modern Statistics for Modern Biology</a> by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber</li>
<li><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz">R for Data Science</a> by Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are new to R or statistics in R, we recommend reading at least the introduction of these books before your first R Friday. In total, the reading is ~ 20 minutes.</p>
<p><em>The readings are suggested starting points if you are new to R or statistics in R. Feel free to skip if they are review for you. </em></p>
